Welcome to my Magic the Gathering Collector App!

This app allows a user to store their personal collection of magic the gathering cards digitally. 
You can search by card name, and then add the card from the correct set to your collection.
Cards without images available will show the image of the back of a magic card, but still display the correct name and set.
You can view details of the cards in your collection, or delete them from your collection.
To leave the card search or details view simply click anywhere outside of those menus.
You can also filter your collection by card type.
The app is not currently connected to a database, but the collection is stored in state.
The app utilizes media queries to handle different screen sizes.
You will notice that there are 6 cards in the collection when you first open the app. 
These are so that you can see how the app works without needing to know the names of any magic cards. 
The 6 cards in the seed data contain one of each kind of card, so you can test the filters.

I hope you enjoy taking at look at MTG Collector!
